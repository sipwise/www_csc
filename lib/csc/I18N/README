                   I18N support for Sipwise NGCP CSC

To update the language strings in this directory you'll first need
xgettext.pl from the liblocale-maketext-lexicon-perl package.
   NOTE: 'xgettext' from the gettext package won't work! Don't try to
         use it here.

Start with running
  xgettext.pl -o lib/csc/I18N/messages.pot root/layout/* root/tt/*
in the CSC trunk (or branch) directory. This will update messages.pot
with all new, changed and removed strings.

Then change to lib/csc/I18N/ and run
  msgmerge --update $LANG.po messages.pot
for all the .po files. (replace $LANG with the language code)

Finally edit the .po files and do the translation. Remove old strings
by deleting the "#~ " quoted lines.
   NOTE: To find strings which require attention, look for empty msgstr
         entries and for entries marked "fuzzy". Don' forget to remove
         the "fuzzy" marks when you're done.
