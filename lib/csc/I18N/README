                   I18N support for Sipwise NGCP CSC

1) Regenerate messages.pot if you have modified template files:

To update the language strings in messages.pot you'll first need
xgettext.pl from the liblocale-maketext-lexicon-perl package.
NOTE: 'xgettext' from the gettext package won't work! Don't try to use
      it here.

Then run
  xgettext.pl -o I18N/messages.pot root/layout/* root/tt/*
in the /usr/share/ngcp-www-csc/lib/csc directory. This will update
messages.pot with all new, changed and removed strings.

2) Update or create $LANG.po files for translation:

You'll need msgmerge from the xgettext package.
Change to the I18N directory and run
  msgmerge --update $LANG.po messages.pot
for all the existing .po files. (replace $LANG with the language code)
To create a new language, just omit the "--update" option and specify a
new filename.

Finally edit the .po files and do the translation. Remove old strings
by deleting the "#~ " quoted lines.
   NOTE: To find strings which require attention, look for empty msgstr
         entries and for entries marked "fuzzy". Don't forget to remove
         the "fuzzy" marks when you're done.
